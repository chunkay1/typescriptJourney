# Overview

TypeScript is JavaScript with a ‘TypeSystem’

TypeScript (and other programming languages) does something called ‘Static Checking’ which means it detects errors in our code **************************************without running it.************************************** It doesn’t actually execute the code - that’s JavaScripts’ job. 

TypeScript does this error checking on the basis of the  ‘kinds of data’ in our program AKA types. 

********************Why Types?********************

- Helps us find errors
- Analyzes our code as we type
- Only exists in development

TypeScript is there for dev purposes only - however when we’re ready to execute our code, it compiles into JavaScript.
